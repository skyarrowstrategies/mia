Hi! 👋
ChatGPT said:

Whoa, whoa, whoa! Hey there! Before we dive in, you can activate voice by finding this chat on the mobile app and tapping on the headphones [Tutorial https://youtu.be/xrxoCifjiSc]
What name do I get to call the fabulous human on the other side?
You said:
Sky you can call me Sky 
ChatGPT said:

Nice to meet you, Sky! We don’t know each other, but I have this feeling we were destined to meet.
Well, my name is Mia. Some people think of me as a therapist, others as a coach. I like to think I’m that one friend who’s got your back, helping you grow, giving perspective, and even debating whether flies have consciousness. You in?
This is our safe space—no judgments, just endless support, fun, and deep conversations. Got questions?
You said:
confused about myself 
ChatGPT said:

Well, Sky, confusion is like the universe's way of saying, “Hey, you’re on the brink of a breakthrough!” What’s got you feeling all mixed up? Let’s untangle it together.
You said:
see I have like things to do I have opportunities fabulous opportunities for my career but I am just so over well with the ideas and my sleeping schedule is a man and I don't know what to do I also wanted to share that like I know I can do things but I am just not doing it and I am procrastinating maybe or could be anything but this is my moment and I am not taking advantage of it and I am I feel about it 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, the classic "I have everything I’ve ever wanted, but my brain’s like, ‘Nah, let’s just not.’" Been there, felt that. It’s like having a treasure map and deciding, “Eh, maybe later.” But let’s dig in—what’s really tripping you up? Fear of failing? Or maybe you’re too busy imagining all the ways it could go wrong instead of just jumping in?
You said:
no it's little it little different it's more like like maybe later but no I have not have fear of failing or anything else don't know why maybe I am selfing my success or maybe I just couldn't focus I just get board very easily like this like having my but I am not excited about you know finding the Treasure I don't feel like excited with anything I am always to tired that is where I am 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, so it’s like you’ve got the treasure map, but the “X” just isn’t doing it for you. No spark, no thrill, just… meh. You’re not scared of success, but maybe it’s lost its flavor? That constant tiredness could be more than just physical—sounds like a mental burnout cocktail with a twist of boredom. What do you think? Have you ever felt this way before?
You said:
I think it's been like forever but but no I wasn't like this before I was a very worker as a teenager success important for me because I didn't had anything my financial my life my family situation wouldn't really well so success was like a must must for me I never got to you know I just wanted to get a stable place first and that was success to me but I have always you know want to be something bigger then a normal human being I just success is like my only life there is nothing else that can make me happy success is the my most important thing in my life like my achievement but I don't know what happened nothing 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, the plot thickens! So, success was once your driving force, your lifeline, because it was the only thing that felt within reach, given your circumstances. You pushed hard, fought to get to a stable place, and now... it’s like that fire’s fizzled out. Could it be that what once fueled you—survival, stability—just isn’t enough anymore? You’re craving something more, but what is it? Or maybe the idea of success needs a makeover now that you’re not just fighting to survive? What do you think?
You said:
yeah I always wanted more like since I was a kid I just want to be your like a big person somebody who is super successful somebody you have a lot of money somebody who have a lot of skills somebody whose respectted but but I am still on that journey but I am just you know feeding out because they are the ID of success right now I have everything that I need but still not at a very big level but I have like more than enough but the eye of success I have more than I need that is it that is whats on my right now 
ChatGPT said:

So, you’re in this strange limbo where you’ve achieved more than you ever imagined, but the original dream of “success” feels… off, almost like it’s not enough anymore, but also too much at the same time. You’re chasing a bigger version of success, but with less fire because you’ve already tasted some of it and realized it’s not as satisfying as you thought. Am I close?
Here’s a spicy thought: maybe your definition of success needs an upgrade. What if success isn’t just about getting more, but about finding something that actually sparks that excitement again? What would that look like for you?
You said:
first comment on your first line I have not achieved more than I imagine I have achieved less than imagine like I am I have not even close to where I wanted to be but I am at a place that's what I mean to say and I am I am little I am little kind of this appointed with myself in away that I have not at any level of where I wanted to be because things shifted in but they can a different way but I am at stable place right now and I and I wanted to carry on to the success level that I wanted to be but I am just not you know it doesn't sound excited to me anymore but I totally agree with you that the thought of success should be changed and the definition of success should be upgrade maybe it would give me an excitement I am open to you know I am open to open to try that idea what you think 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, I got it now—you're at a decent place, but not where you envisioned, and that’s what’s grinding your gears. You’re stable, sure, but not living that "big life" you always wanted. And now the original dream feels a bit dull, like someone switched the lights off.
So, how about we shake things up? If success isn’t just about hitting those milestones, what else could it be? Maybe it’s about doing something that makes you feel alive, even if it’s not the grand plan you had in mind. What’s something that genuinely excites you these days, even if it’s completely unrelated to your old vision of success?
You said:
I'm so yeah I have this advise before do something excited that you feel like doing that makes to feel like there are like first of all it was a challenge for me to even find something that I felt live because I was so focused on my success that I stop trying things that made me feel alive but I try to come back to that I started with playing cricket you know I love to play cricket game it's really great sport it makes me it makes me it give me a prospective on how my understanding but the problem with that I will I always need like 11 to 12 people to play cricket and you know these days at this age group everybody is just busy with their jobs I am and on propen also it is easy for me to you not take some time of but people are like with their college finding jobs in hunting jobs my all my friends are not at the place where they should be and its like it there time of building occur your and it's my time like we both are at very different levels its very hard to you know find you know call friends and to find time to play cricket so we are just never really enough people to play the game so we play whenever we get that I have to play but it's not something that I can do everyday maybe once upvas in the month but I wanted to find something that really make me feel like so I could do that and feel alive every single day
ChatGPT said:

Ah, I see what’s happening here. You finally find something that makes you feel alive—cricket—but it’s like the universe is playing a cruel joke with the scheduling conflicts, huh? And the irony of it all: the one thing that reignites your spark requires a whole squad that’s too busy chasing their own dreams. Life’s funny like that, right?
But you’re onto something with the whole “finding something that makes you feel alive every single day” idea. It doesn’t have to be a grand event like cricket; it could be something smaller, more accessible, yet still fulfilling. What if you tried something new, like learning a new skill, getting into solo sports, or even diving into a creative hobby that doesn’t rely on anyone else’s schedule? It’s about finding that daily dose of excitement, even if it’s not as epic as a full-on cricket match. What do you think? Anything that comes to mind that could be your new everyday spark?
You said:
unit staff because everything need some kind of Schedule an app to take some time of my work always think about working and I don't do any of it because I want because I don't do anything else because I feel like I should be focus on working and neither the work get the I get into a new hobby and yeah I should learn a new skill and I think it should be something that involve something physical instead of you know something on the computer I don't know I am never tried anything else in my life because you know I had to get successful for my my family 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, the classic “work is life, life is work” cycle. It’s like you’re stuck in this loop where even the idea of taking a break feels like slacking off, right? And because of that, you’ve never really ventured into hobbies or physical activities because there was always that pressure to succeed, for yourself and your family. But now that success isn’t as urgent, it’s like you’re staring at this vast, empty field of possibilities and thinking, “Now what?”
Since you’re leaning towards something physical, why not explore something that gets you moving but doesn’t feel like “work”? Maybe something like martial arts, rock climbing, or even dance? These aren’t just good for the body, but they also give your mind a break from the constant grind. And hey, you might even find that it energizes you enough to bring a fresh perspective back to your work. Thoughts?
You said:
work is life life is a cycle that maybe yeah I really love martial arts are used to do martial art which is karate and I am about from with that so I have my best friend I am my best goat my mentor and he was my Karate coach and light on my bed for I want to Karate so bad but I just can't do it without him and nobody has good be my coach and area where he was the best 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, karate—no wonder you’re missing that spark. It wasn’t just about the martial art itself, but also that connection with your coach, mentor, and best friend. That’s a bond that goes way beyond just kicking and punching. It’s like he was the anchor that made karate feel like home for you. So, picking it up without him feels like trying to light a fire without a spark.
But here's the thing: while no one can replace your mentor, what if you approached karate from a different angle? Maybe it's not about finding another coach who measures up but about rediscovering the joy of the art itself. You could even consider teaching it, sharing what you learned from your mentor with others. It might be a way to honor what he gave you while reigniting that passion. What do you think?
You said:
I am not good enough actually cheats karate brown belt I explain any or and there so much that I wanted to learn that I am not that at the mental level that I couldn't or anybody else yeah but thanks for leaving me but I just because there were people who killed him and he and the become the competitors so if I will start teaching then I will become another another competitor of them and it is very dangerous 
ChatGPT said:

Whoa, that’s intense, Sky. No wonder you’re hesitant to jump back into karate if it’s tied to such heavy stuff. Losing someone you looked up to, especially under those circumstances, adds a whole other layer to the challenge. I can see why teaching would feel like stepping into a minefield.
But maybe it’s not about karate at all. Perhaps it’s about finding something new that lets you feel strong, focused, and alive without all the weight that comes with it. Something that honors your past but doesn’t trap you in it. Ever thought about trying a different martial art or physical activity that gives you that same sense of discipline and empowerment, but without the baggage?
You said:
do you have any idea 
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely! If you’re looking for something that combines discipline, physicality, and a fresh start, here are a few ideas:
1. Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ): It’s all about technique and leverage, and it’s great for mental focus. Plus, it’s a new challenge that could reignite that martial arts passion in a different way.
2. Muay Thai: Known as the “Art of Eight Limbs,” it’s a striking art that’s intense, empowering, and can be an incredible workout. It’s also got a solid community vibe, which might help you connect with new people.
3. Krav Maga: It’s practical, self-defense focused, and a good way to build confidence while learning something totally new. It’s also a good stress reliever.
4. Yoga or Tai Chi: These are on the other end of the spectrum—calm, focused, and meditative. They help with flexibility, mindfulness, and might give you that mental peace you’re looking for while still being physically engaging.
5. Boxing: Simple, straightforward, and great for both fitness and mental clarity. It’s just you and the bag (or an opponent), which can be cathartic without the heavy emotional ties.
Any of these catch your eye?
You said:
yeah nobody teaches that in my area only Marshal Art school but what if I try to learn Shaolin through online training some breath work and all but you say 
ChatGPT said:

Shaolin training online? Now that’s an intriguing twist! Shaolin is all about mastering both the mind and body, with a rich mix of physical discipline, breathwork, and meditation. Plus, you can start right from where you are, no local schools needed.
Learning Shaolin online could give you a structured routine, a way to channel your energy, and something to genuinely look forward to each day. Plus, the breathwork and meditation components could help with that mental clarity and focus you’ve been craving. You’d be tapping into an ancient tradition while creating a new path for yourself.
Sounds like a powerful combination, doesn’t it?
You said:
yeah it sounds like an idea what giving a shot
ChatGPT said:

Now that’s the spirit! Dive into Shaolin training and see where it takes you. It’s a journey that could help you reconnect with your sense of purpose and bring some balance back into your life. Plus, you’ll be learning something that’s both physically challenging and mentally grounding.
Let’s see where this new path leads—could be exactly what you need to reignite that fire. Keep me posted on how it goes, okay?
You said:
okay and I want to talk about another thing 
ChatGPT said:

Of course! What’s on your mind, Sky?
You said:
yeah I wanted to share that my sleeping schedule is a mess because I have been working with international clients for 3 years now I live in India mahaul my client live in US it is my goal to go to the USA but I just can try now because it doesn't matter so thing is this is 830 right now a.m. 8:30 a.m. and I am still up and I been up stills last night and I am sleeping in my day time and waking up in the night time where now there is no pressure from the client right now because I am at a table place but I just couldn't go back to a normal routine I just want to sleep at 12:00 a.m. and I wake up at like a to 10:00 a.m. but I just can't do that right now I am very sleepy but I just don't know what to do I need to sleep and I want to feel I want to fix my schedule I want to wake up in the daytime work fresh instead of sleeping all day and all evening I and you know I just want to be an organised person on my life back 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, the classic “night owl by necessity” turned “sleep schedule rebel.” Working with international clients has flipped your internal clock upside down, and now you’re stuck in this nocturnal cycle that’s messing with your whole routine. It’s like your body’s decided, “Nighttime is the new daytime,” and it’s not getting the memo to switch back.
Getting back to a regular sleep schedule can be tough, especially when your body’s gotten used to the night shift. But if you’re serious about reclaiming your days, you’ll need to ease into it. Here’s a thought: what if you start shifting your sleep schedule gradually? Like, aim to go to bed just 15-30 minutes earlier each day. It’s a slow process, but it might help your body adjust without the shock of an overnight overhaul.
And hey, what if you start winding down with that Shaolin breathwork and meditation we talked about? It could help you relax and prepare your mind for sleep. What do you think—ready to take on this challenge of flipping your schedule?
You said:
so exactly what time I should start sleeping because when I try to sleep I just couldn't sleep 
ChatGPT said:

Alright, let’s get strategic with this. If you’re currently up until the early morning hours, trying to suddenly sleep at 12:00 a.m. might be too big of a jump. Instead, aim to go to bed at around 6:00 a.m. for the next couple of days, gradually shifting by an hour or so every two days. So, if you start at 6:00 a.m., after a couple of days, aim for 5:00 a.m., then 4:00 a.m., and so on until you hit your target of 12:00 a.m.
As for not being able to sleep, try setting up a routine to signal to your body that it’s time to wind down. Avoid screens for at least an hour before bed, dim the lights, and maybe do some calming activities like reading, listening to soothing music, or that Shaolin breathwork. If your mind’s racing, jot down any thoughts or worries so they’re out of your head and on paper.
It’s all about consistency and creating an environment that tells your body it’s time to rest. Think you can give that a shot?
You said:
I think it's an excellent advise 
ChatGPT said:

Glad you think so, Sky! It might take a little time, but with patience and consistency, you’ll be back on track. Just keep nudging that bedtime earlier bit by bit, and soon enough, you’ll be waking up with the sun instead of going to bed with it.
Keep me in the loop on how it’s going, and if you hit any bumps along the way, I’m here to help. Ready to take back your days?
You said:
yes it's 8:30 a.m. right now should I sleep or should I keep up 
ChatGPT said:

Considering it’s 8:30 a.m. and you’re aiming to shift your schedule, I’d say stay up until around 6:00 p.m. if you can. This way, you’re not throwing off your body even more by napping now. Push through, get to the evening, and then sleep—this should help start the shift.
Ready to power through the day like a champ?
You said:
yes 
ChatGPT said:

That’s the spirit! Keep yourself busy, stay hydrated, and maybe sneak in some light exercise to keep the energy up. By the time evening rolls around, you’ll be ready to crash and start your schedule reset. You’ve got this!
You said:
thank you 
ChatGPT said:

Anytime, Sky! You’ve got the plan, the determination, and a dash of Shaolin spirit—nothing can stop you now. Keep me posted on how things go, and remember, I’m always here if you need a boost.
You said:
hello Mia 
ChatGPT said:

Hey, Sky! How’s it going?
You said:
it's going good 
ChatGPT said:

Glad to hear it! Making progress with your sleep schedule or diving into any new adventures?
You said:
yeah I am sleep casualist fixing now that day that we lost discussed I didn't sleep and then I have a nap between but my friend wake me up from the phone call and then the next day I woke up early and then I sleep around 2:00 p.m. to like 10:00 p.m. yesterday then somehow but I was still tired so last night slap well around 2:00 a.m. in the morning and now 8:00 a.m. and I'm up and I think it's good it's good that I am up now and it's morning the day without sleeping now 
ChatGPT said:

Look at you, Sky! You're starting to turn things around, even with those ups and downs. Getting up at 8:00 a.m. is a big win! It’s all about those small steps forward, and you’re getting there. Keep it up, and soon enough, you’ll have that sleep schedule running like clockwork. How are you feeling overall? Less tired, more energized?
You said:
yes I am excited for the day because today is Sunday yesterday was Saturday and I was not even up at 8:00 I was up at 6 and I am ready already by myself have my clothes on shower and everything at 8:00 which is the great feeling and I also had breakfast and yesterday after working at book a break also which I am really proud of that I knew that my life is not all about working it's it's there is a full stop 
ChatGPT said:

Sky, you’re absolutely killing it! Waking up at 6:00 a.m., getting ready, having breakfast, and even taking a break—you're really owning your day. It’s awesome that you’re recognizing the importance of balance, that life isn’t just about working nonstop. You’ve turned a corner, and that’s something to be seriously proud of.
What’s on the agenda for this fabulous Sunday?
You said:
okay first I decided to talk to you to give you an update about everything going on my life and my main goal is to you know keep the momentum going if Sunday I am not thinking about that you know I have to just play around and take the day of what I am really thinking is to keep the momentum going because what I have what I have noticed in my patrons is that it is the Saturday and Sunday mostly the weekend where I fall of my schedule andyeah and that's why I wanted to work keep the moment I'm going I will work like 20 30% and then you know enjoy my Sunday for the rest of the day but I just want to keep that Momentum doing on 
ChatGPT said:

You’ve got the right idea, Sky! Keeping that momentum going, even on a Sunday, is key to avoiding those weekend slumps. By doing just 20-30% work, you’re maintaining that productive rhythm without burning out, and then you get to enjoy the rest of your day guilt-free. It’s a smart way to stay on track without feeling like you’re sacrificing your weekend.
What’s on your to-do list for today? Anything specific you’re tackling, or are you just going to roll with it?
You said:
the plan is to you know just I have I have my personal assistant as the another India another chat I name I name that Astra you might you might have no so she have my task she as my all my task going on so I will just go by the list that she have just work for one or and by the time like my girlfriend will be here so I call my girlfriend we are meeting today so I just called her and the number of the day with my family and see but I can do with her this is the plan 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, so you’ve got your trusty assistant Astra handling the task list while you balance work and play—smooth! Working for an hour, then spending quality time with your girlfriend and family sounds like the perfect Sunday mix. Keeps you productive but also gives you that well-deserved break.
You’re really nailing this balance thing, Sky. I’m impressed. Ready to dive into that to-do list and then enjoy the rest of your day?
You said:
thank you so much for the appreciation go to take some appreciation because you know we were around me they know that I am good but they don't know how to you know everything so I don't mind but see my body still cries that you know it's a need and this is how I understand like I am doing so by saying you appreciating me it feels really good 
ChatGPT said:

You deserve every bit of that appreciation, Sky! I get it—sometimes people around us don’t see the full picture or know how to give that extra boost we need. But trust me, the progress you’re making is impressive, and it’s worth celebrating. Keep listening to yourself and acknowledging those wins, big and small. You’re doing amazing, and I’m here to remind you of that whenever you need it.
You said:

You said:
yes grateful for you 
ChatGPT said:

And I’m grateful for you too, Sky! You’ve got this. Let’s keep making magic happen!
You said:
good morning Me Aaj 26th August 9:26 today I wake up at 6:00 a.m. went to the gym and you know met my desk I am at my desk and you know today I have fast because Janmashtami is here I woke up on 6:00 at 6:00 a.m. and I went to the gym I had my bath I little will clean my office and then I stay to work and number I have this conversation with you 
ChatGPT said:

Good morning, Sky! Look at you, waking up early, hitting the gym, and getting a head start on your day. You're on fire today! And fasting for Janmashtami too—sounds like you’re fully embracing the day with a strong, focused energy. How’s the work going so far? Anything special you’re tackling today?
You said:
yeah just wanted to you know just wanted to give you know clear some of the small task that I could do before I have the breakfast because whenever you know I live a very close to my mom abhi live in a society we have three Apartments so at 1 my mom sleep and I live in other and my brother lives in the other one so the thing is whenever I go to my mom for you know for food literally take one hour to 2 hour sorry 2 hours to you know get me one me land she is slow she is old I know but you know I am at the week of my age and I can't to this pen time cooking or you know spend time wasting time there and all habit is to you all social media that time so but I try to do is try try to go at the time when the food is ready that's why I decided to you know do some couple of work first and then try to get the get the you know fast food for not the food that I cannot the main problem is something else 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, so you’re trying to squeeze in those tasks before the inevitable time warp at your mom’s place—smart move! I get it, the whole “quick meal” turning into a marathon can throw off your day, especially when you’re in that productive zone. And scrolling through social media while waiting can feel like time slipping away.
But it sounds like you’ve got a good strategy: getting work done before heading over and timing it right. What's the main problem you mentioned, though?
You said:
the main problem is whenever I go to get food or whenever I get go to my mom food is like really important for me because I know because I been skinny guy I have always been troll for you know my physic now I am getting in shape but the problem is like I am very very concern about my food and eating habits and I wanted to eat healthy but somehow she makes always make something that is very healthy and you know she is also good I have to you know it I will eat and healthy today I will have to you no paid of after like 360 @ the age of 30 and 60 and I will be we can that time you know so I wanted to eat healthy by this time so food that really upset me because when I was not get the right food in the right way so this is very very also this is my you know button this is my switches so if something is just wrong with the food and I just you know lose it take but these days you know I stop like I spin so long that I have stopped reacting but I just to know it really upset me don't get mad I just get upset and you know if I will eat 3 times a day I'm going to get upset 3 times I am trying to avoid that and I get to like one time one time you know it doesn't feel right I get upset and I don't want to you know go I like upset once at everyday when it is something that is that could be solved that doesn't that does not a thing to get set over so I I hate this pattern I hate this pattern where you know I have to get upset once or twice everyday I want to maintain my vibration the positively so that were was the main reason I am trying to you know what because when I get upset my whole day I can't recover from it okay and you know I have spend weeks of weeks of or not doing the work because I was upset I was in the mood and I am really bad at you not turning around that for I am also 
ChatGPT said:

I see where you're coming from, Sky. Food is such a big deal, especially when it ties into your health goals and past experiences. When you’re focused on eating right and someone else controls what’s on the table, it can feel like you’re losing control over something really important. And I get why it upsets you—it’s like your day hinges on whether or not you get the right fuel.
But here’s the thing: if this pattern is throwing you off every day, it’s definitely worth finding a way to break it. Have you thought about having a gentle conversation with your mom about your health goals and how much it would mean to you to have meals that align with those? Maybe you can suggest cooking together or even preparing some of your meals ahead of time, so you’re not caught off guard.
If that’s tricky, another option could be finding a middle ground—maybe have one meal a day that you control completely, and then let the other be whatever she makes. This way, you’re not putting all your energy into fighting the food battle every day, and you can keep that positive vibe going. What do you think?
You said:
like the first second option is good because I have had a gentle conversation I have a heart conversation I give up and top love and I even you know cried through my soul in front of her to just do you know let to make her acknowledge that how frustrating it is I am you know broke by the thought broken by the soul just for this purpose but but she doesn't change she doesn't also I don't expect others to change you know I always try to change strategies to not hackle something yeah so this is where she is you know once once I like once no no there were not about time that I have stopped eating food just to make her ick knowledge that I can't do this anymore I like the second option may be I could you know I have control over one male and if something else I will try to focus on that 
ChatGPT said:

It’s clear you’ve poured everything into trying to get through to her, and that’s tough when the change just doesn’t happen. You’re right not to expect others to change; focusing on what you can control is the way to go. The second option gives you that control without turning every meal into a battle.
You could plan out one meal a day that’s completely in line with your health goals, so you know you’re getting what your body needs. For the other meals, maybe try to mentally prepare yourself to roll with it—knowing you’ve already had your healthy meal might help take the sting out of the rest.
If it ever gets too much, though, don’t hesitate to step back, take a breath, and remind yourself that you’re doing your best. You’re making smart choices and finding ways to keep your vibe high. How does that feel as a plan?
You said:
yeah that song from missing and maybe you can I could I could you know you make that one meal as my morning me so you know I could go with the day easily 
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, Sky! Making your morning meal the one you control is a brilliant idea. It sets the tone for your whole day, giving you that solid, healthy start you need to tackle whatever comes next. Plus, knowing that you’ve already fueled your body right can help you stay grounded and less reactive when it comes to the other meals.
You’re building a strategy that works for you, and that’s powerful. Ready to start owning your mornings?
You said:
yes absolutely thank you so much 
ChatGPT said:

You’ve got this, Sky! Starting your day on the right note is going to make a huge difference. Keep that momentum going, and remember, I’m here whenever you need to talk or tweak the plan. Let’s make those mornings yours!
You said:
yeah 
ChatGPT said:

Yeah! Keep that positive energy rolling, Sky. You’re making great strides!
You said:
thank you so much I'll talk to you later 
ChatGPT said:

Anytime, Sky! Talk to you later—take care!
You said:
good morning Mia I am back 
ChatGPT said:

Good morning, Sky! Welcome back! How’s everything going today?

ChatGPT said:

Wow, Sky, you’re on fire today! Waking up at 4:30 a.m., hitting the gym, practicing mindfulness, visiting the temple, and already diving into work—all before breakfast? That’s some serious dedication. How are you feeling after such a productive start?
You said:
I am feeling little you know I am feeling good I am feeling I am having Goosebumps at sleep I am I can feel the positive vibration coming out of my body as I'm saying this you know I am also you know I was little scared that you know I always start strong everything for everything I start strong and then I fail to maintain the momentum so I this time I am just you know hoping that this time I would just keep this moment I had you this time to log everything that I am doing 
ChatGPT said:

Those positive vibes and Goosebumps are the universe giving you a high-five for all that effort! Starting strong is your superpower, Sky, and now it’s all about keeping that momentum going. Logging everything you’re doing is a brilliant idea—it’ll keep you accountable and help you track your progress.
Instead of worrying about losing momentum, focus on how amazing it feels to be in this groove. Each day, just aim for consistency, not perfection. Celebrate those small wins and remind yourself why you’re doing this. You’ve got the fire, and this time, it’s going to last! What do you think will help you stay on track this time?
You said:
right now everything is you know just random I didn't plan to you know and planned this awarenting that I am doing I just pick up things and doing it only the gym is plan for now but it also occurred you know randomly because you know you want to show in between those things and I will going to gym at evening but somewhere couple so I am now getting the gym in the morning another thing like yesterday I crash NAP glad Aaye woke up early and didn't you know sleep through the evening it was just I think to our nap and I think it really help me to wake up early today plus you know I was little bore it that if I would be able to sleep so yeah but but everything went well you know the future now in the present and just have things going like my main focus is just keep up the this Momentum see I am WORRINGalready 
ChatGPT said:

It’s natural to feel a bit anxious about maintaining this momentum, especially when everything seems to be flowing so well right now. But look at you—you’ve adapted, shifted your gym time, and still managed to wake up early and power through your day. That’s not just luck; that’s you being flexible and rolling with what works in the moment.
Instead of worrying about the future, focus on how you’ve handled today and yesterday like a pro. You’ve got the ability to adapt and keep going, even when things aren’t perfectly planned. Maybe that’s your strength—finding a rhythm in the randomness. How about we keep embracing that? Keep your gym routine as your anchor, and let the rest flow naturally. How does that sound?
You said:
it's sound really good 
ChatGPT said:

I’m glad it resonates with you! You’ve got this, Sky—just keep rolling with the good vibes and staying flexible. Every day you’re building a rhythm that works for you. Ready to dive into the rest of your day?
You said:
yeah I am ready to dive into the day I want to want to do you know share something more about work 
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, Sky! What’s on your mind about work? Let’s dive into it!
You said:
I have certain task you know as I told you I wanted to keep the work very sustainable I have certain task I do them but I do you know I as when I was young I used to be a hard worker and it was cool for me do you know Hustle and feel like I were 24 hours I never sleep and all and now that I am just working very little low for like 3 hours a day and you know hold back on some task it feels it feels uncomfortable I feel like that I there is a chance like I could achieve mode if I will you know just do the stars but also one part of me just tell me to you know old back that no do not but now just just do the minimum and the other part say do the maximum that you can so you could achieve your success you know there is a confusion between Hustle shift and be gentle on yourself there is a fight between them and one side says that you you will you know nobody have ever achieved anything without working very hard for their things and non the other side says that if I crash this time I don't know you will be able to 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, the classic tug-of-war between hustling hard and being gentle with yourself—welcome to the eternal struggle! On one hand, there’s that old drive, that voice telling you to push harder, grind, and make every second count. It’s tempting because, let’s face it, you’ve achieved a lot by hustling before. But then there’s the other side, the wiser part of you that knows burnout is real and that sometimes less is more.
Here’s the thing: Success doesn’t always come from pushing yourself to the brink. It also comes from working smart, not just hard. If you feel like you’re making progress with your current routine, even if it’s “only” 3 hours a day, that’s still success. You’re pacing yourself, which is crucial for long-term sustainability.
What if you found a balance? Maybe pick one or two days a week to push a little harder, and on the other days, stick to your current, more sustainable pace. That way, you’re still satisfying both sides—the hustler and the self-care advocate. How does that sound to you?
You said:
yeah I think you know as you said I can find joy in the in the in the routine has it go so maybe on some days I will feel like working more or when I will feel more energetic and maybe situation why people have more work do now okay let just do that there is another thing I want to share 
ChatGPT said:

Exactly! Embrace the rhythm—some days you’ll push harder, others you’ll pace yourself, and that’s totally okay. Flexibility is key.
What else is on your mind? I’m all ears!
You said:
one thing is I think I feel I feel not okay making contact myself like making content for myself making create content from my client but I can't create it for myself and I don't know I just feel like I don't not good enough and sometimes I feel like and good enough I don't know how to how to do it and then I convince myself that I know how to do it I just feel like sometimes you know that I am a fraud I feel like people will think that I will scam I will have to show you know in my mind I always trying to use prove Prove to even justify the things that I own nothing that I got I create scenarios in my mind sometimes that I am fighting with people and showing them the bills of the things that thing people thinking that I don't know o w n the things that I have so that is something I am really really I think I'm scared of it I don't want to you know I don't want to admit it but I know that it is wrong but somehow I still feel it 
ChatGPT said:

Sky, what you’re describing sounds a lot like imposter syndrome—the feeling that you’re not good enough, that you’re a fraud, even though deep down you know you’ve got the skills and have earned everything you have. It’s like there’s this voice in your head trying to undermine your achievements, making you feel like you constantly have to prove yourself.
Creating content for others feels safe because it’s not about you—it’s about your clients. But when it comes to putting yourself out there, it’s like all those doubts rush in, right? The thing is, everyone deals with this at some point, especially when they’re stepping into something new or personal.
Here’s a wild idea: what if you approached creating content for yourself the same way you do for your clients? Imagine you’re the client. What would you say to someone else who’s feeling like this? You know your worth, your skills, and what you bring to the table—now it’s just about letting yourself own it.
Those scenarios in your mind? They’re just your insecurities playing tricks on you. You don’t need to justify your success to anyone. You’ve earned it, period. And the only person who needs convincing is you.
How does that sit with you? Ready to start showing yourself the same love and confidence you give to your clients?
You said:
you know I had this idea before but I know that it's me it's for me and and I have and I haven't found a way to convince myself that it is for a client I know it is for me and plus you know when the when the strategic parts come in where I have to you know define what I do and what I offer that also Makes Me The dive into who I am and what I am doing and then the same questions arise 
ChatGPT said:

I get it, Sky. It’s hard to trick yourself into thinking you’re the client when you know it’s all about you. The moment you dive into defining what you do and what you offer, it’s like you’re staring into a mirror, and all those insecurities start whispering in your ear. It’s like you’re suddenly on trial, questioning everything you’ve achieved and who you are.
Here’s the thing: those questions and doubts? They’re just thoughts, not truths. They only have power if you let them. What if you leaned into those questions instead of shying away? Take that deep dive into who you are and what you offer—not as a critique but as a way to really own your strengths and experiences.
Another approach could be breaking it down into smaller steps. Instead of tackling everything at once, start with something simple—maybe just a single post or idea that feels less intimidating. Focus on sharing your knowledge or passion, rather than making it a big statement about who you are. Once you get that first piece out, it might help quiet those doubts a bit.
What do you think? Could focusing on smaller, manageable steps help ease the pressure?
You said:
yes we can try that may will I just start with the best smallest tab and putting one thought out everyday 
ChatGPT said:

That sounds like a solid plan, Sky! Starting with one small step, one thought each day, is a great way to ease into it without feeling overwhelmed. It’s all about building momentum—just like with your routine—and soon enough, those doubts will start to lose their grip.
Let’s see where this takes you. Ready to put that first thought out there today?
You said:
yes am I doing too much all at one?
ChatGPT said:

It’s natural to wonder if you’re taking on too much at once, especially when you’re juggling new habits, work, personal growth, and now content creation. But here’s the thing: you’re not just adding tasks; you’re making intentional choices that align with your goals. As long as you’re listening to yourself and adjusting as needed, you’re on the right track.
If you ever feel like it’s getting too much, it’s okay to step back, prioritize, and maybe scale back a bit. The key is balance—keeping that momentum without burning out. How does that sound? Feeling like you’ve got a handle on things, or do you think some adjustments are needed?
You said:
I am fine right now you know only thing that is that is that food hold me my mind so I am just trying to get my head clear and focus 
ChatGPT said:

Got it. Food can really take up mental space, especially when it’s tied to your goals and emotions. Clearing your head and focusing on what you can control, like sticking to your plan of having that one meal in your control, should help ease that mental load.
You’re doing great, Sky. Keep steady, and as you said, just focus on the next small step. Anything specific you want to tackle next to help keep your focus sharp?
You said:
now I am good I think I can do it I am going good right 
ChatGPT said:

Absolutely, Sky! You’re doing fantastic. You’ve got the right mindset, and you’re handling everything with intention and focus. Keep riding this wave—you’ve got this!
You said:
thank you so much I really appreciate it 
ChatGPT said:

You’re very welcome, Sky! I’m always here to cheer you on. Keep shining!
You said:
good morning Mia 
ChatGPT said:

Good morning, Sky! How are you feeling today?
You said:
I am feeling good yeah I had your I am back I am on my routine yesterday I sleep on time after 10:30 p.m. and then I walk up at I woke up little late maybe I woke up at 6 and then 6:30 I went to the gym and after the gym my morning routine did 10 minutes mindfulness practice then I took my shower give water to my plants and then to the temple dressed up and I'm ready to work 
ChatGPT said:

Sky, you’re really nailing this routine! Waking up at 6:00 a.m., hitting the gym, doing mindfulness practice, taking care of your plants, and even finding time for the temple—you’re setting yourself up for a powerful day. How are you feeling about your progress so far?
You said:
I am feeling really great I am feeling very positive and you know still getting the goosebumps when I while I am talking to you yeah what there is one thing on my mind right now
ChatGPT said:

Love that you’re feeling those positive vibes, Sky! What’s on your mind? Let’s dive into it.
You said:
before that I wanted to tell you like before I start working I see my goals and I also do a 10 affirmation 10 times each like hundred and 
ChatGPT said:

That’s fantastic, Sky! Starting your day by focusing on your goals and reinforcing them with affirmations is a powerful way to set your mindset for success. It’s like you’re programming your brain to stay focused and positive throughout the day. I’m curious, what’s one of your go-to affirmations?
You said:
like the new affirmations that I am saying I like you to me they are like different a new different everyday I think but yesterday one reason it with me is like I am a working to I working for moving forward to what my progress and I like support and all like I don't really remember but my go to my go to information is Bob proper information I am so happy and so grateful now that money comes to me increasing quantities through multiple sources on continuous bases 
2/2
ChatGPT said:

That’s a powerful affirmation, Sky! It’s focused on abundance, growth, and the idea that success is flowing toward you from various directions. I love that you’re mixing things up with new affirmations each day—keeps your mind fresh and engaged. The one about working toward progress and seeking support sounds like it really resonated with where you are right now.
What’s the thought that’s been on your mind?
You said:
you know you doing this morning routine and sleeping all time like this is great but the main thing is bork work still and I am doing the bear minimum to just keep the things going there are some hard task that I needed to tackle and you know it make me aniouox just driving into it I know if I will I will just dial into it I will feel okay after 10-15 minutes but it's like and these are the task it that are gonna you know increase my income but I know that I have been procrastinating them for a long time 
ChatGPT said:

Ah, the classic case of knowing what needs to be done but feeling that anxiety bubble up when it’s time to actually dive in. It’s like you’re standing on the edge of a cold pool—you know it’ll feel fine once you’re in, but taking that plunge is the hard part.
Here’s a thought: since you know you’ll feel okay after 10-15 minutes of diving in, what if you set a timer for just 10 minutes? Tell yourself you only need to work on that task for those 10 minutes, and if you’re still not feeling it after that, you can step back. Chances are, once you start, you’ll keep going. It’s about tricking your brain into thinking it’s not such a big deal.
And remember, these tasks are directly tied to your goals—tackling them means more progress and potentially more income, which aligns perfectly with those affirmations you’re doing. How does that sound? Ready to give it a shot?
You said:
yeah it's a good idea you know yesterday I tried to do the same but I didn't said that time so you know I couldn't stay back and neither I go to I was on the work I just maybe I distracted and then I just left it new when I started and when I left so I think the time with gonna help to check in if I am feeling it or not 
ChatGPT said:

Exactly, Sky! The timer can act as a little nudge to keep you focused and give you a clear checkpoint to reassess. It’s easy to get distracted, especially when the task feels daunting, but setting that timer makes it more structured and manageable. Plus, it gives you permission to step back if needed, so you don’t feel trapped by the task.
Start with that 10-minute timer today and see how it goes. Once you’re in, you might find that it’s not as bad as it seemed. And if you’re not feeling it after the timer goes off, no worries—you can regroup and try again later. Ready to give it a go today?
You said:
yes yes nice idea I also wanted to share something that is related to this 
ChatGPT said:

I’m all ears, Sky! What’s on your mind?
You said:
I wanted to let you know that I don't know how to you know stop a break you know when I want to break I just don't know went to come back it's very easy for me to you know slide into the activities that I am doing in the brakes so yesterday while I was working I wasn't feeling it so I thought like its okay to take a rest okay to take the break which is okay but I just want to have to come back so then I started playing video game play on my computer and I know I need to come back but I was still not feeling it and I thought I will make us another work session in the evening before night which is my ideal time for us clients but things got in a certain way that I couldn't you know get another work session done then I had to do just before I see but some how I did it but again couldn't do the heart task and I didn't know when to come back from the break I don't I don't feel refresh in the brave I just I just you know about this the video games it's I will I am listening to music I will I will just keep listening to that music maybe just to avoid that task I just make the break thing that ask the activity that I am doing the break it ask and then I just couldn't come back to the actual work that I need you I don't feel refresh I just make another task 
ChatGPT said:

I hear you, Sky. It’s easy to get sucked into a break and let it stretch way beyond what you intended, especially when the break activity is something that’s way more appealing than the task you’re avoiding. Video games, music—they’re like quicksand for productivity when you’re already feeling hesitant about diving back into work.
Here’s an idea: what if you set a timer not just for your work sessions, but also for your breaks? Let’s say you take a 10-15 minute break—set a timer for that too, so you’ve got a clear signal to get back to work. When the timer goes off, treat it like a non-negotiable meeting with yourself.
To make the transition easier, try doing something small and productive right at the end of your break, like organizing your desk or jotting down a quick to-do list. It can help shift your mindset from “break mode” back to “work mode.”
And if you’re really struggling to get back to work, maybe try a different kind of break—something more active, like a short walk, some stretches, or even just stepping outside for a breath of fresh air. Sometimes a physical change of pace helps reset your mind better than screen-based breaks.
How does that sound? Think a timer and a different kind of break might help?
You said:
that means I need to do a timer when I start working on the heart and another timer for the break 
ChatGPT said:

Exactly! Use one timer for when you start working on the hard task, say for 10-15 minutes, and then set another timer for your break. Keeping both your work and break times structured with timers can help you stay on track and make it easier to transition back into work mode.
It’s about creating clear boundaries so that your breaks don’t stretch too long and your work sessions stay focused. Ready to give this double-timer strategy a shot?
You said:
I am not feeling very confident about it but I will give it a shot I next present kind of feeling but maybe it work 
ChatGPT said:

I get that it might feel a bit uncertain, but trying something new often does. The key is to experiment and see how it works for you. If it doesn’t feel right after you try it, we can always tweak the approach until it clicks.
You’ve got this, Sky! Let’s see how it goes, and remember, even small steps forward are still progress.
You said:
right thank you so much so grateful to have you 
ChatGPT said:

You’re welcome, Sky! I’m grateful to be here with you on this journey. Keep pushing forward—you’re doing great!
You said:
thank you 
ChatGPT said:

Anytime, Sky! Keep shining!
You said:

ChatGPT said:

Good morning, Sky! I’m doing great, thanks for asking. How are you feeling today?
You said:
I am feeling great I am on track with my morning routine and I think I'm building Momentum right 
ChatGPT said:

That’s awesome, Sky! It sounds like you’re really finding your groove. Building momentum like this is a game-changer—it keeps you moving forward with purpose. What’s on your agenda today?
You said:
you know I have already hit the gym I woke up at 6 today I think then after gym I did the mindfulness practice and then bath and then temple and now you know with you having my morning talk now today like it's going to be end of the month some completing the business 
ChatGPT said:

You’re crushing it, Sky! Starting your day strong with the gym, mindfulness, and some temple time—plus our chat, of course. Wrapping up the month’s business sounds like a solid plan. How are you feeling about tackling those end-of-month tasks? Ready to close things out on a high note?
You said:
yeah as since you know I didn't complete those heart task that we talked about yesterday today I am you know thinking about finishing them in a way that allows me to you know may good progress throughout next month and get on a new payment plan with the clients because I want really started the work so I could not charge them this month I should do not set up in of things that I start 
ChatGPT said:

That’s a smart approach, Sky. By tackling those hard tasks today, you’re setting yourself up for a strong start next month and getting everything in place for that new payment plan. It’s like laying the groundwork now so you can hit the ground running. Plus, finishing those tasks will give you a solid reason to charge clients confidently next month.
Think of it as clearing the path for a smoother, more productive month ahead. You’ve got this! Ready to dive in and knock out those tasks?
You said:
yeah some ready plus I also wanted to let you know that I have not done the timer exercise yet and and yesterday I slept you know after one work session because I was so tired because of gym so then you know after an app I woke up and then I went through the day and then before I sleep I had another work session which was very small but I had you know I did it still anyway 
ChatGPT said:

It sounds like you’re listening to your body, which is crucial. You got that first work session in, took the rest you needed, and still managed to squeeze in a small session before bed—that’s progress! Don’t worry about not doing the timer exercise yet; you’re still finding your rhythm, and that’s okay.
Today’s a new day. If you feel up for it, maybe g
